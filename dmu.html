    <h3 class="yes">DMU's emphasis on primary care is important to me as I pursue a career as a family practice physician. In the last 5 graduating classes, DMU students specializing in family medicine have scored above the national mean on the COMLEX Level-2 CE examination. </h3>

    <h4 class="yes">A key inspiration in my pursuit of medicine was a family practice physician who donated his time to athletics at my high school while I was an athlete. I would like to volunteer in this capacity as a physician and I am excited about the opportunities at DMU with the Osteopathic Finish Line and the Drake Clinic </h4>
