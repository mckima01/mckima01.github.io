     <h2 class="yes">Des Moines University is the number one choice for my medical education for a variety of exciting reasons. </h2>
   <img id="c" src="http://ceph.org/assets/DMU_logo.jpg" alt=height="700" Width="800">
    
    <h3 class="yes">DMU's emphasis on primary care is important to me as I pursue a career as a family practice physician. In the last 5 graduating classes, DMU students specializing in family medicine have scored above the national mean on the COMLEX Level-2 CE examination. </h3>

    <h4 class="yes">Furthermore, a key inspiration in my pursuit of medicine was a family practice physician who donated his time to athletics at my high school while I was an athlete. I would like to volunteer in this capacity as a physician and I am excited about the opportunities to get involved with athletics at DMU through the Osteopathic Finish Line and the Drake Clinic programs. </h4>

    <h5 class="yes">I value history, and as the 2nd oldest osteopathic medical school in the United States DMU has a long tradition of success. I have also had a long history in my interest to become a physician. Pictured below is an excerpt from my Kindergarten year book with my drawing of "what I want to be when I grow up". Much thought, exploration, and showdowing has taken place since I was this age, but ultimately becoming a doctor has always been my life goal. </h5>

    <h6 class="yes">As a lifelong resident of an Iowa town with a population of 346 individuals, I strive to become a practicing physician in rural Iowa. Therefore, I am excited about the elective in rural medicine offered in the curriculum at DMU and the opportunity to do a rotation in rural medicine during the 4th year curriculum.</h6>

    <h7 class="yes">Extensive conversation with a current 2nd year DMU medical student have demonstrated to me that DMU has a very collaborative atmosphere where I could put to use the teamwork skills I have gained in college athletics and through leadership roles in campus organizations. If offered an acceptance I would undoubtedly attend Des Moines University and I anxiously await the alternate list process.</h7>
